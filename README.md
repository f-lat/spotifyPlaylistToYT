# spotifyPlaylistToYT (outdated)
converts a spotify playlist To YouTube Links.


# steps

1. you have to get client id and client secret from spotify dashboard
2. once my code has generated a links.txt you can have a chrome extension open these links for you
3. add them to a playlist (youtube) 
4. use a online youtube downloader to download the playlist loader.to works well




YES I KNOW THIS IS A VERY BAD METHOD TO DO THIS, BUT THIS THE ONLY WAY WITHOUT DOWNLOADING SOME RANDO PIECE OF SOFTWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER.
